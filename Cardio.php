      <h3>Jogging</h3>
      
      <p>Jogging is a mid-intensity cardio exercise in which an individual trots or runs slowly for an extended period. The pace of jogging is faster than brisk walking and slower than running, allowing joggers to maintain steady movement without overexertion. Jogging is gentler on the body than running at full speed, which places additional stress on the runner’s knees and joints.

         Jogging can occur outdoors or on an indoor treadmill and can be a standalone wellness activity or a form of cross-training for another, higher-intensity exercise.</p>

      <h3>Jumping Jax</h3>
      
      <p>Jumping jacks are a type of plyometrics, which is a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance work. They may improve strength and agility and possibly even your bone density. Plyometric exercises, like jumping jacks, are intended to help people run faster and jump higher. That’s because plyometrics work by rapidly stretching the muscles (eccentric phase) and then rapidly shortening them (concentric phase).</p>
