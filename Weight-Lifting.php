      <p>The Barbell Row is a strength training exercise that primarily targets the muscles in the back, but also works the biceps and the muscles in the hips and legs. The Barbell Row starts with you standing over a barbell, bending at the hips and knees, and grabbing the bar with an overhand grip. Your back should be straight, not rounded, and almost parallel to the floor. You then pull the barbell towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. After a brief pause at the top, you lower the barbell back to the starting position.</p>

      <h3>Chin ups</h3>
      
      <p> A chin-up is a challenging but empowering exercise1. It involves standing with your arms shoulder-width apart and reaching up to grab an overhead bar1. You use an underhand grip, so your palms face toward you1. You then brace your abdominal muscles to create tension throughout your body, which increases your stability as you move1. You pull yourself up from your stationary position until your chin is above the bar1. Your legs should remain as still as possible and your neck should be in a neutral position, with your head facing forward.</p>

You then push back up to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.</p>

You then curl the barbell up until it reaches shoulder level, keeping your elbows close to your torso1. After a brief pause at the top, you slowly lower the barbell to the starting position. This movement is considered one repetition.</p>
